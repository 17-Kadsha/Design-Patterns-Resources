# Design Pattern: Singleton in Java

## Definition
The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This means there is a single, shared object of the class that can be accessed from anywhere in your Java application.

## Explanation in Simple Terms
Imagine you have a special, one-of-a-kind cookie jar. The Singleton pattern is like having a rule that says, "There can only be one cookie jar in your kitchen, and everyone has to use that same jar." This means that no matter how many people want cookies or need to put cookies away, they all use the same jar.

In Java, this pattern is used to create a single instance of a class that can be accessed by any part of your program. It's like having a single, global cookie jar that holds the "cookie" (data or functionality) you want to share among different parts of your code.

## Code Related Explanation
Here's a simple Java code example to illustrate the Singleton pattern:

```java
public class Singleton {
    // Private static variable to hold the single instance
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from other classes
    private Singleton() {
    }

    // Public method to get the single instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Add other methods and data members as needed
}

// Usage:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get the singleton instance
        Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance();

        // Now you can use the singleton object to access its methods and data
    }
}
```

In this code:

1. We have a private static variable instance to store the single instance of the Singleton class.
2. The constructor Singleton() is private, meaning it can only be called from within the class itself, preventing external instantiation.
3. The getInstance() method is used to get the instance of the Singleton class. If an instance doesn't exist, it creates one; otherwise, it returns the existing instance.
4. You can add your methods and data members to the Singleton class as needed.

By using the Singleton pattern, you ensure that there is only one instance of the Singleton class, and this instance is shared across your entire application. This means that any changes to the singleton instance are visible to all other parts of your program.
