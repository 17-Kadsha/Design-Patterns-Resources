## Definition
The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It falls under the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns and is widely used in software development to ensure the compatibility of the created objects.

## Explanation in Simple Terms
Imagine you're building a complex application, and you need to create different types of objects that belong to specific families. These families of objects must work together seamlessly. The Abstract Factory pattern allows you to define a factory interface that knows how to create these objects, but it doesn't specify the actual classes of objects. Concrete implementations of this interface (concrete factories) are responsible for creating objects that work well together and are consistent with the chosen factory. This helps in keeping your code flexible and easy to maintain, as you can switch between different families of objects by changing the concrete factory.

For example, in a video game, you might have different platforms (e.g., Xbox, PlayStation, PC) and each platform requires a different set of objects (controllers, graphics, sound). You can use the Abstract Factory pattern to create a factory for each platform, ensuring that all objects created are compatible with that specific platform.

## Code-Related Explanation
In Java, implementing the Abstract Factory pattern involves defining an abstract factory interface and multiple concrete factories that implement this interface. Each concrete factory is responsible for creating a family of related objects. You can then use the appropriate concrete factory in your code based on the desired family of objects.

Here's a basic code structure for the Abstract Factory pattern in Java:

```java
// Abstract Factory Interface
interface AbstractFactory {
    ProductA createProductA();
    ProductB createProductB();
}

// Concrete Factory 1
class ConcreteFactory1 implements AbstractFactory {
    public ProductA createProductA() {
        return new ConcreteProductA1();
    }
    
    public ProductB createProductB() {
        return new ConcreteProductB1();
    }
}

// Concrete Factory 2
class ConcreteFactory2 implements AbstractFactory {
    public ProductA createProductA() {
        return new ConcreteProductA2();
    }
    
    public ProductB createProductB() {
        return new ConcreteProductB2();
    }
}

// Abstract Product A
interface ProductA {
    void displayInfo();
}

// Concrete Product A implementations
class ConcreteProductA1 implements ProductA {
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Product A1");
    }
}

class ConcreteProductA2 implements ProductA {
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Product A2");
    }
}

// Abstract Product B
interface ProductB {
    void displayInfo();
}

// Concrete Product B implementations
class ConcreteProductB1 implements ProductB {
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Product B1");
    }
}

class ConcreteProductB2 implements ProductB {
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Product B2");
    }
}
