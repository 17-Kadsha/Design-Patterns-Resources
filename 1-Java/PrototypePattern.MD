# Prototype Pattern in Java

## Definition:

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern in Java. It is used to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern allows you to duplicate an object, including its properties, without the need to create it from scratch. It's particularly useful when you want to create multiple instances of an object with similar characteristics, avoiding the overhead of repeatedly creating them.

## Explanation in Simple Terms:

Think of the Prototype Pattern as a template or blueprint. You have an original object (the prototype), and you can make copies of it whenever needed. Just like making duplicates of a document, you can create new objects with the same properties as the prototype. This pattern is like a cloning machine for objects.

In the context of Java, you define a prototype object, and then you can create new instances by cloning the prototype. It's handy when you want to save time and resources by reusing existing object structures with minor variations.

## Code-Related Explanation:

The Prototype Pattern is typically implemented as follows in Java:

Create an interface or abstract class (e.g., Cloneable) that declares a clone method.
Create concrete classes that implement the interface and provide their own clone method.
Develop a prototype manager or factory that maintains a collection of prototypes.
When you need a new object, you ask the manager to clone the desired prototype.
Here's a simple code example:

```java
// Step 1: Define a prototype interface
interface Prototype {
    Prototype clone();
}

// Step 2: Create a concrete class implementing the prototype
class ConcretePrototype implements Prototype {
    private int data;

    public ConcretePrototype(int data) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    @Override
    public Prototype clone() {
        return new ConcretePrototype(this.data);
    }

    public int getData() {
        return data;
    }
}

// Step 3: Create a prototype manager (not shown in the example)

// Step 4: Client code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Assuming you have a prototype manager
        PrototypeManager manager = new PrototypeManager();
        
        // Add prototypes to the manager
        manager.addPrototype("PrototypeA", new ConcretePrototype(10));
        
        // Create new objects by cloning
        Prototype clonedObject = manager.getPrototype("PrototypeA");
        
        if (clonedObject != null) {
            System.out.println("Original Data: " + ((ConcretePrototype) clonedObject).getData());
        }
    }
}
