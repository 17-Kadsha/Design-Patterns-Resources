# Prototype Pattern in Java

## Requirement Definition:
You want to understand and potentially contribute to a GitHub repository that uses the Prototype Pattern in Java.

## Explanation in Simple Terms:
The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern in Java that is used for creating new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern allows you to create new objects with the same properties as the original object, saving the effort of creating them from scratch.

Think of it like a photocopy machine. You have an original document (the prototype), and you can create multiple copies of it without rewriting the entire content. In the context of Java, the Prototype Pattern helps you avoid the overhead of creating complex objects repeatedly by simply cloning an existing object.

## Code-Related Explanation:

Let's look at an example in Java to understand the Prototype Pattern

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

// The prototype interface that all concrete prototypes will implement
interface Prototype {
    Prototype clone();
}

// Concrete prototype class
class ConcretePrototype implements Prototype {
    private int data;

    public ConcretePrototype(int data) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    @Override
    public Prototype clone() {
        // Create a new instance by copying the current object
        return new ConcretePrototype(this.data);
    }

    public int getData() {
        return data;
    }
}

// Prototype manager
class PrototypeManager {
    private Map<String, Prototype> prototypes = new HashMap<>();

    public void addPrototype(String key, Prototype prototype) {
        prototypes.put(key, prototype);
    }

    public Prototype getPrototype(String key) {
        Prototype prototype = prototypes.get(key);
        if (prototype != null) {
            return prototype.clone();
        }
        return null;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a prototype manager
        PrototypeManager manager = new PrototypeManager();

        // Create a prototype object and add it to the manager
        ConcretePrototype prototype = new ConcretePrototype(10);
        manager.addPrototype("PrototypeA", prototype);

        // Create a new object by cloning the prototype
        Prototype clonedObject = manager.getPrototype("PrototypeA");

        if (clonedObject != null) {
            System.out.println("Original Data: " + prototype.getData());
            System.out.println("Cloned Data: " + ((ConcretePrototype)clonedObject).getData());
        }
    }
}

```
