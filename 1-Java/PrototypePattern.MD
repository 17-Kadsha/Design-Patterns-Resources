# Prototype Pattern in Java

## Definition:

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by duplicating an existing object, known as the prototype. It involves creating new objects with the same structure as the prototype, typically by using a clone or copy operation.

## Explanation in Simple Terms:

Think of a prototype as a blueprint or template for creating new objects. If you have a prototype of an object, you can make as many copies of it as you want. It's like making photocopies of a document â€“ the copies have the same content and format as the original.

## Code-Related Explanation:

In Python, you can implement the Prototype Pattern using different approaches, but a simple way is to use the copy module. Here's a basic example:

```java
import copy

class Prototype:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = []

    def clone(self):
        # Use copy.deepcopy to create a deep copy of the object
        return copy.deepcopy(self)

# Create a prototype object
prototype = Prototype()
prototype.data.append(1)

# Clone the prototype to create a new object
new_object = prototype.clone()

# Both the prototype and the new object have the same data
print(prototype.data)  # Output: [1]
print(new_object.data)  # Output: [1]

# Modify the data in the new object
new_object.data.append(2)

# The prototype's data remains unchanged
print(prototype.data)  # Output: [1]
print(new_object.data)  # Output: [1, 2]

```
