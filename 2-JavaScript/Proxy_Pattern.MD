# Proxy Pattern in JavaScript
## Definition
The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides an object (proxy) that acts as a substitute for another object (real subject). The proxy controls access to the real subject, allowing you to add additional functionality or restrict access as needed. This pattern is useful for implementing lazy loading, access control, logging, and more.

## Explanation in Simple Terms
Think of a proxy as a middleman or a representative. Imagine you have a personal assistant who screens your phone calls. The assistant acts as a proxy, filtering and controlling access to you. In programming, the Proxy Pattern is like having a protective barrier around an object. Instead of directly interacting with the real object, you go through the proxy, which can perform additional actions or validations before passing the request to the real object.

### Implementation
To implement the Proxy Pattern in JavaScript, you typically have a proxy class that has the same interface as the real subject. The proxy controls access to the real subject and can intercept requests, add behavior, or restrict access.

```JavaScript
class Proxy {
  constructor(realSubject) {
    this.realSubject = realSubject;
  }

  request() {
    if (this.checkAccess()) {
      this.realSubject.request();
      this.logAccess();
    } else {
      console.log('Proxy: Access denied.');
    }
  }

  checkAccess() {
    // Implement access control logic here
    return true;
  }

  logAccess() {
    console.log('Proxy: Logging the time of request.');
  }
}
```
