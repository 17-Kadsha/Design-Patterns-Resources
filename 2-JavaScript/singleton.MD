# Singleton Pattern in JavaScript



## Definition
The Singleton pattern is a design pattern in JavaScript that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance. It ensures that there's only one object created from a particular class, providing a single point of access to that instance throughout the application.

## Explanation in Simple Terms
In simple terms, the Singleton pattern is like having a single key to a unique treasure chest. It ensures that there's only one chest (object) created, and you can always access it with the same key (instance) no matter where you are in your code.

Imagine a game where there can only be one player character. The Singleton pattern ensures there's only one player character object in the entire game, and you can always interact with that character no matter where you are in the game's code.


## Code Related Explanation

Here's an example of how you can implement the Singleton pattern in JavaScript:

```bash
  class Singleton {
  constructor() {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = this;
    }
    return Singleton.instance;
  }

  someMethod() {
    // Your methods and properties here
  }
}

const instance1 = new Singleton();
const instance2 = new Singleton();

console.log(instance1 === instance2); // This will be true, as both instances refer to the same object
```
In this code:

- We create a Singleton class with a constructor.
- Inside the constructor, we check if an instance of the class
- already exists. If it does, we return the existing instance; 
- otherwise, we create a new instance.
- This ensures that no matter how many times you create a Singleton object, you will always get the same instance.
- The Singleton pattern is useful when you want to control access to shared resources or manage global state in your application.
