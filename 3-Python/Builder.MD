## Definition

The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. It allows you to create an object step by step, customizing its type and content. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to construct complex objects with multiple optional components.

## Explanation in Simple Terms

Think of the Builder pattern as a way to build a custom order for a meal. You have different components, like the type of burger, toppings, and a drink. Instead of having a single complex constructor for a meal object, the Builder pattern provides a step-by-step approach where you can customize each part of your meal before it's ready.

## Code Related Explanation

In this repository, we've provided a Python example to demonstrate the Builder Design Pattern. We have a `MealBuilder` class that creates complex `Meal` objects with various components such as a burger and a drink. The `MealBuilder` class allows you to customize the meal by selecting specific items and combinations. This pattern promotes flexibility and clarity when constructing complex objects.

## Usage

You can use this repository to understand how the Builder Design Pattern works in Python. Clone the repository and explore the code to see how the pattern is implemented.

```python
# Example usage:
meal_builder = MealBuilder()

veg_meal = meal_builder.prepare_veg_meal()
non_veg_meal = meal_builder.prepare_non_veg_meal()
