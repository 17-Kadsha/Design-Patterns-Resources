# Design Prototype Pattern

This repository provides an overview of the Prototype Design Pattern, a creational pattern in object-oriented software design. The pattern allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as a prototype. This README will explain the pattern in simple terms and provide code-related explanations and examples.

## Definition

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object (the prototype) rather than creating them from scratch. In essence, it serves as a blueprint for creating objects with the same structure and properties. This pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating an object is more expensive than copying an existing one.

## Explanation in Simple Terms

Imagine you have a highly customizable car, and you want to create new cars with the same configuration. Instead of building each car from scratch, you can use the Prototype Pattern. In this analogy, the original car is the prototype. You can make as many copies of it as you want, making slight modifications like changing the color or adding features. This pattern is like photocopying a document instead of typing it all over again.

## Code-Related Explanation

Here's a basic example in Python to illustrate the Prototype Pattern:

```python
import copy

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def clone(self):
        return copy.copy(self)

# Create a prototype car
prototype_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry")

# Clone the prototype to create new cars
car1 = prototype_car.clone()
car2 = prototype_car.clone()

# Modify the clones
car1.model = "Corolla"
car2.make = "Honda"

print(prototype_car.make, prototype_car.model)  # Output: Toyota Camry
print(car1.make, car1.model)  # Output: Toyota Corolla
print(car2.make, car2.model)  # Output: Honda Camry
