## Definition

The Proxy Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It's typically used to add an extra layer of control and functionality to an object without the client code being aware of it. This is often used for purposes such as lazy initialization, access control, monitoring, or logging.

## Explanation in Simple Terms

Think of a proxy as a representative or a middleman. Imagine you have a secure access card to enter a restricted area, but instead of going directly to the door, you need to go through a security checkpoint where they verify your access rights. The security checkpoint is acting as a proxy. It adds a layer of control and security before granting access to the actual resource. In the same way, a proxy in software acts as an intermediary to control access to an object.

## Code-Related Explanation

Here's a basic example in Python to illustrate the Proxy Design Pattern:

```python
# Define the interface for the real object and proxy
class Subject:
    def request(self):
        pass

# Create the real object
class RealSubject(Subject):
    def request(self):
        print("RealSubject: Handling the request.")

# Create the proxy
class Proxy(Subject):
    def __init__(self):
        self._real_subject = RealSubject()
    
    def request(self):
        # Add extra functionality before forwarding the request
        print("Proxy: Checking access rights...")
        if self.check_access():
            self._real_subject.request()
            self.log_access()
    
    def check_access(self):
        # Simulate access control logic
        print("Proxy: Checking access... Access granted.")
        return True
    
    def log_access(self):
        # Log access
        print("Proxy: Logging the request.")

# Client code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    proxy = Proxy()
    proxy.request()
